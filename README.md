# scientific_programing
Repository to store the practicals of the subject scientific programing from MBDS

Hi there 👋 !


The aim of this github is to create a short collaborative story for practicing with Git and GitHub. 

The group is composed by @Marc Olmo and @Joan Pau Gutiérrez, being Marc the leader.

We initially created the main and 2 other branches (one of each member where each one can perform pulls and merges of his own history/code version)

Schematicly the idea is the following to perform the collaboratory story.

We explain our day activity (morning, afternoon and night) making each pull and merge for each mornign ,afternoon and night activity as we explain in this image just to get into collaboratory coding inside Github:

Hope we did it right!
